/*
App Interfaces
The team at Computron Computing has asked you to join their product team to develop the hottest new Computron computer. You’ll be responsible for building some of the standard apps on this new machine, specifically the to-do list and the password manager.

At this point in development, you have two classes started: TodoList representing the to-do list application, and PasswordManager representing the password manager. In order to work within the Computron system, every app must have a display and reset feature. In other words, each class will need to implement the IDisplayable and IResetable interfaces.

Classes can implement multiple interfaces using the colon and comma syntax:

class TodoList : IDisplayable, IResetable
{}

Let’s get started! Make sure to save every file and test your code in the console with the command:

dotnet run

/*
1.
Get comfortable with the two classes TodoList and PasswordManager. In Program.cs, an instance of each class is constructed.

In TodoList.cs, read the definition of the constructor and Add() method.
In PasswordManager.cs, read the definition of the constructor.
IDisplayable
2.
Every app must have a display feature. In IDisplayable.cs, define an empty IDisplayable interface.

3.
Within IDisplayable declare one method that:

is named Display()
returns nothing
4.
In TodoList.cs, update the class declaration to include the IDisplayable interface.

5.
The class must actually implement the interface by defining a Display() method.

Define a method that:

satisfies the interface requirements
uses Console.WriteLine() to write each to-do item to the console
6.
Repeat the process for PasswordManager.

Declare that it implements IDisplayable.

7.
Define a Display() method that:

satisfies the interface requirements
uses Console.WriteLine() to print the actual password if Hidden is false. If Hidden is true, print asterisks *
8.
Make sure that both classes are printable.

In Program.cs, call Display() on tdl and pm. Run the program with:

dotnet run

Copy to Clipboard

You should see both objects printed to the console.

IResetable
9.
Every app must have a reset feature. In IResetable.cs, define an IResetable interface with one method:

name it Reset()
it should return nothing
10.
In TodoList.cs, implement the interface:

Declare that it implements IResetable.
Define a Reset() method to satisfy the interface. It should set the Todos property to an empty array of length 5 and set nextOpenIndex to 0.
11.
In PasswordManager, implement the interface:

Declare that it implements IResetable.
Define a Reset() method to satisfy the interface. It should set Password to an empty string and set Hidden to false.
12.
In Program.cs, call Reset() and Display() with tdl and pm. In other words, both objects should display, then reset, then display again.

Run the program with:

dotnet run

Extensions
13.
Well done! The Computron is a better computer thanks to your work. If you’d like extra practice, try these optional challenges:

Add a get-only property to IDisplayable called HeaderSymbol. This should be used in Display() as a header. For example, if the header symbol is -, then the apps should be displayed as:

Todos
--------
Eat
Sleep
Code

Password
-----------
***

Copy to Clipboard

If you add more than five to-dos to the TodoList, it throws an error! Extend the Add() method so that it doesn’t add any more than five items to the Todos array.

Currently, a blank line is printed for each empty index in Todos. Change Display() in TodoList so that it prints [] instead of a blank line. You’ll need to use the static method String.IsNullOrEmpty().

Add a method ChangePassword() to PasswordManager. It should:

take 2 string parameters
reset the Password to the second argument if the first argument matches the existing Password
return true if the password change was a success (the first argument matched the old password), and false otherwise
Extend the Password property in PasswordManager:

Change the set method so that it requires the password to be at least eight characters in length.
