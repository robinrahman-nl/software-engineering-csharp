Review
Well done! In this lesson, we:

learned that 
interfaces
Preview: Docs An interface is an abstract contract that defines methods and properties that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
 are useful to guarantee certain functionality across multiple classes
built an interface using the interface keyword
defined properties and 
methods
Preview: Docs Methods are blocks of code that can be called elsewhere in the program.
 (but not constructors or fields) in the interface
built 
classes
Preview: Docs A blueprint or template for creating objects.
 that implemented the interface
inherit from a base class and implement one or more interfaces
Your C# skills are growing. Keep up the good work!

Instructions
The completed implementation is provided in the editor. Make sure you are comfortable with interfaces before you move on from this lesson.

Vehicle.cs defines the base class that Sedan and Truck inherit from.
IAutomobile.cs defines the interface.
Sedan.cs and Truck.cs define two classes that implement the interface.
Program.cs demonstrates those classes in action.
