.
With inheritance, one class inherits the members of another class.
The class that inherits is called a subclass or derived class. The other class is called a superclass or base class.
We can access a superclass’ members using base. This is very useful when calling the superclass’ constructor.
We can restrict access to a superclass and its subclasses using protected.
