🎓 Software Engineering Basics (C#) 


Foundations of Modern Backend Development

Welcome to my Software Engineering Basics repository — a structured collection of learning modules completed as part of the Galileo IT Software Engineering Track (C# / .NET).
This repo contains my foundational work in C#, OOP, data structures, LINQ, and Git, reflecting my growth from fundamentals toward professional software development.

🧱  What This Repository Covers

This repository includes all core modules from the first phase of the Software Engineering program, organized into clear folders:
software-engineering-basics/
│
├── 1_Learn_CSharp/          → C# syntax, variables, loops, methods
├── 2_OOP_In_CSharp/         → Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
├── 3_References/            → Reference types, mutability, memory behavior
├── 4_Lists_And_LINQ/        → Collections, IEnumerable<T>, LINQ (query & method syntax)
├── 5_Learn_Git_And_Github/  → Git fundamentals, branching, commits, workflows
│
└── README.md                → Overview and structure of this repository

Each module contains hands-on exercises, explanations, and working code examples.

🚀 Learning Objectives

Throughout this repository, I built strong foundations in:

✔ C# Programming Fundamentals
	•	Types, variables, conditionals, loops
	•	Methods and parameters
	•	Namespaces and file structure

✔ Object-Oriented Programming
	•	Encapsulation
	•	Inheritance
	•	Polymorphism
	•	Abstract classes & interfaces
	•	Constructors & overloading

✔ References & Memory Behavior
	•	Value types vs reference types
	•	Shallow vs deep copying
	•	Mutable vs immutable objects

✔ Collections & LINQ
	•	Lists, arrays, dictionaries
	•	Query expressions
	•	Method syntax (Where, Select, OrderBy, GroupBy)
	•	Deferred execution
	•	Lambda expressions

✔ Git & Version Control
	•	Commits, branches, merges
	•	GitHub workflows
	•	Writing clean commit messages
	•	Working with feature branches
	•	Understanding real-world Git Flow

📌 Why This Repo Exists

This repository serves three purposes:
	1.	A structured archive of my core software engineering foundations
	2.	A reference point for future advanced modules (SQL, ASP.NET, Capstone)
	3.	A transparent demonstration of my progression for hiring managers and peers

This is not a product repository — it’s a learning repository that demonstrates the groundwork on which my later professional projects are built.

🔭 Next Steps in the Program

After completing the basics, the next modules (each in their own dedicated repos) are:
	•	SQL Database Design
	•	ASP.NET / Razor Pages (Admin Portal project)
	•	Full C# / .NET Capstone Project

These will showcase full-stack .NET development with real application features.
